      Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by
      Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by
      scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby,
      the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1962, and
      received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his
      creation, Iron Man became a founding member of the superhero team, the
      Avengers, with Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man stories,
      individually and with the Avengers, have been published consistently since
      the character's creation.

    <h2>Publication History</h2>

    <h3>Premier</h3>
    <p>
      Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent
      revival of American comic books featuring superheroes, Marvel Comics set
      about creating new superhero characters. Stan Lee developed the initial
      concept for Iron Man.[1] He wanted to design a character who should be
      unpalatable to his generally anti-war readers, but to make them like the
      character anyway.[2] Iron Man was created in the years after a permanent
      arms industry developed in the United States, and this was incorporated
      into the character's backstory.[3] The character was introduced as an
      active player in the Vietnam War. Lee described the national mood toward
      Vietnam during Iron Man's creation as "a time when most of us genuinely
      felt that the conflict in that tortured land really was a simple matter of
      good versus evil".[4]

    <h3>Solo Series</h3>
    <p>
      Iron Man's earliest stories were published in the monster-themed anthology
      series Tales of Suspense. Marvel premiered several superheroes this way in
      the 1960s as superhero comics became more popular than traditional
      science-fiction and horror comics.[9][12] Iron Man's first appearance,
      "Iron Man is Born!", appeared in Tales of Suspense #39, released in
      December 1962 with a March 1963 cover date.[12] Though the Iron Man armor
      was gray in its first appearance, Marvel changed it to gold because of
      issues with printing.[5] Lee initially delegated the writing duties to
      other creators at Marvel, but he felt their work was substandard; as with
      his other characters, Lee reclaimed control of Iron Man so he could write
      the stories himself.[13]

    <h2>Fiction Character Biography</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      As a child, Tony Stark inherits his family's business, Stark Industries,
      when his parents are killed in a car crash.[82] Developing equipment for
      the U.S. military, he travels to a war zone to conduct a weapons test when
      he triggers a booby trap. His heart is critically injured by shrapnel, and
      he is captured by the communist Wong-Chu, who demands Stark build him a
      weapon. Stark instead builds a suit of armor that sustains his heart,
      becoming Iron Man.[15][9] The war zone Stark visited was changed
      retroactively multiple times by different writers to correspond with the
      character's age, which is explained by a "sliding scale of continuity" in
      which the timing of significant events in the world of Marvel may change.
      This conflict was the Vietnam War for the first decades of Iron Man's
      publication history.[83] This was changed to an unnamed Southeast Asian
      country in the 1990s,[84] and a conflict in the fictional country Siancong
      was ultimately created to justify the inconsistency.[85]
